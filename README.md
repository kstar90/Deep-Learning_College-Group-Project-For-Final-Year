# Deep-Learning_College-Group-Project-For-Final-Year
Here, I gave three codes for my deep learning project. These three codes provide a pipeline for YOLO object detection on videos and images, calculating detection accuracy using Intersection over Union (IoU) against ground truth annotations, and plotting accuracy, precision, and recall metrics for multiple images.
